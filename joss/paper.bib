	abstract = {Interpretable policy learning seeks to estimate intelligible decision policies from observed actions; however, existing models fall short by forcing a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. This tradeoff limits data-driven interpretations of human decision-making process. e.g. to audit medical decisions for biases and suboptimal practices, we require models of decision processes which provide concise descriptions of complex behaviors. Fundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they represent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact human decisions are dynamic and can change drastically with contextual information. Thus, we propose Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which re-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task learning problem in which complex decision policies are comprised of context-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy as a linear observation-to-action mapping, and generates new decision models \${\textbackslash}textit\{on-demand\}\$ as contexts are updated with new observations. CPR is compatible with fully offline and partially observable decision environments, and can be tailored to incorporate any recurrent black-box model or interpretable decision model. We assess CPR through studies on simulated and real data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the canonical tasks of predicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units (\$+22{\textbackslash}\%\$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimer's patients (\$+7.7{\textbackslash}\%\$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA). With this improvement in predictive performance, CPR closes the accuracy gap between interpretable and black-box methods for policy learning, allowing high-resolution exploration and analysis of context-specific decision models.},

Contextualized ML estimates heterogeneous functions by applying deep learning to the meta-relationship between contextual information and context-specific parametric models. This is a form of varying-coefficient modeling that unifies existing frameworks including cluster analysis and cohort modeling by introducing two reusable concepts: a context encoder which translates sample context into model parameters, and sample-specific model which operates on sample predictors. We review the process of developing contextualized models, nonparametric inference from contextualized models, and identifiability conditions of contextualized models. Finally, we present the open-source PyTorch package ContextualizedML.},

	abstract = {Cancers are shaped by somatic mutations, microenvironment, and patient background, each altering gene expression and regulation in complex ways, resulting in heterogeneous cellular states and dynamics. Inferring gene regulatory network (GRN) models from expression data can help characterize this regulation-driven heterogeneity, but network inference requires many statistical samples, traditionally limiting GRNs to cluster-level analyses that ignore intra-cluster heterogeneity. We propose to move beyond cluster-based analyses by using contextualized learning, a multi-task learning paradigm which allows us to infer sample-specific models using phenotypic, molecular, and environmental information pertinent to the model, encoded as the model's "context" to be conditioned on. We unify three network model classes (Correlation, Markov, Neighborhood) and estimate context-specific GRNs for 7997 tumors across 25 tumor types, with each network contextualized by copy number and driver mutation profiles, tumor microenvironment, and patient demographics. Contextualized GRNs provide a structured view of expression dynamics at sample-specific resolution, which reveal co-expression modules in correlation networks (CNs), as well as cliques and independent regulatory elements in Markov Networks (MNs) and Neighborhood Regression Networks (NNs). Our generative modeling approach allows us to predict GRNs for unseen tumor types based on a pan-cancer model of how somatic mutations affect gene regulation. Finally, contextualized networks enable GRN-based precision oncology, explaining known biomarkers in terms of network-mediated effects, and leading to novel subtypings for thyroid, brain, and gastrointestinal tumors that improve survival prognosis.},

	abstract = {Context-specific Bayesian networks (i.e. directed acyclic graphs, DAGs) identify context-dependent relationships between variables, but the non-convexity induced by the acyclicity requirement makes it difficult to share information between context-specific estimators (e.g. with graph generator functions). For this reason, existing methods for inferring context-specific Bayesian networks have favored breaking datasets into subsamples, limiting statistical power and resolution, and preventing the use of multidimensional and latent contexts. To overcome this challenge, we propose NOTEARS-optimized Mixtures of Archetypal DAGs (NOTMAD). NOTMAD models context-specific Bayesian networks as the output of a function which learns to mix archetypal networks according to sample context. The archetypal networks are estimated jointly with the context-specific networks and do not require any prior knowledge. We encode the acyclicity constraint as a smooth regularization loss which is back-propagated to the mixing function; in this way, NOTMAD shares information between context-specific acyclic graphs, enabling the estimation of Bayesian network structures and parameters at even single-sample resolution. We demonstrate the utility of NOTMAD and sample-specific network inference through analysis and experiments, including patient-specific gene expression networks which correspond to morphological variation in cancer.},

	abstract = {Testing multiple treatments for heterogeneous (varying) effectiveness with
respect to many underlying risk factors requires many pairwise tests; we
would like to instead automatically discover and visualize patient
archetypes and predictors of treatment effectiveness using multitask
machine learning. In this paper, we present a method to estimate these
heterogeneous treatment effects with an interpretable hierarchical
framework that uses additive models to visualize expected treatment
benefits as a function of patient factors (identifying personalized
treatment benefits) and concurrent treatments (identifying combinatorial
treatment benefits). This method achieves state-of-the-art predictive
power for COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and interpretable identification
of heterogeneous treatment benefits. We first validate this method on the
large public MIMIC-IV dataset of ICU patients to test recovery of
heterogeneous treatment effects. Next we apply this method to a
proprietary dataset of over 3000 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, and
find evidence of heterogeneous treatment effectiveness predicted largely
by indicators of inflammation and thrombosis risk: patients with few
indicators of thrombosis risk benefit most from treatments against
inflammation, while patients with few indicators of inflammation risk
benefit most from treatments against thrombosis. This approach provides an
automated methodology to discover heterogeneous and individualized
effectiveness of treatments.},

	abstract = {We consider the task of knowledge graph link prediction. Given a question consisting of a source entity and a relation (e.g., Shakespeare and BornIn), the objective is to predict the most likely answer entity (e.g., England). Recent approaches tackle this problem by learning entity and relation embeddings. However, they often constrain the relationship between these embeddings to be additive (i.e., the embeddings are concatenated and then processed by a sequence of linear functions and element-wise non-linearities). We show that this type of interaction significantly limits representational power. For example, such models cannot handle cases where a different projection of the source entity is used for each relation. We propose to use contextual parameter generation to address this limitation. More specifically, we treat relations as the context in which source entities are processed to produce predictions, by using relation embeddings to generate the parameters of a model operating over source entity embeddings. This allows models to represent more complex interactions between entities and relations. We apply our method on two existing link prediction methods, including the current state-of-the-art, resulting in significant performance gains and establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. These gains are achieved while also reducing convergence time by up to 28 times.},
